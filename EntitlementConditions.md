## Conditions of Entitlement

My knowledge about aging, including but not limited to [SoA](../README.md), will push sciences and technologies about life to a new frontier. It will lead to new knowledge, products, practices, and services that alleviate or eliminate current aging-related conditions and extend human lifespan. Under the law of the Humanunity, the united humanity, I will own the veto power to all the knowledge, products, practices, and services, including those by or from other people. Specifically, I will have the power to stop anyone from using my knowledge or any of its derivatives.

The notation of "life extension" in this article refers to the use of knowledge, products, practices, and services that are from or based (directly or indirectly) on my knowledge about aging.

By default, all people will be entitled to life extension. However, there are conditions for some people.

Some conditions of entitlement are as follows:

#### Climate change

For the future of humankind, climate change must be tackled immediately and at all costs. The goal is to stop it as soon as possible with a deadline of 10 years (before 2032). The deadline may be adjusted according to the science.

The governments will be responsible for the regulations. The richest people (top 10%) will be responsible for the funding.

For everyone relevant, the first action must be taken before 2023. Substantial efforts, such as the allocations of fundings and resources, must be made every year.

Failure at any time will result in an irremediable loss of the entitlement to life extension.

Any influential action, such as lobbying, that conflicts with the goal will result in an irremediable loss of the entitlement to life extension.
