## Conditions of Disclosure

Below is an incomplete list of the conditions of disclosure of my knowledge about aging, including but not limited to [SoA](../README.md).

- All countries are dissolved. Humanity is united into one body, the Humanunity (temporary name).
- The making of the constitution and laws of the Humanunity is directed by me.

Some rules of the Humanunity that have been predetermined are as follows:

- There are no kings, queens, or privileged people or groups of any kind.
- Everyone is equal in terms of basic needs. Universal guaranteed quality life is a human right.
- Scientists are truly honored and listened to, especially in matters that are related to the survival of humankind.
- A scientist owns the veto power to its discovery and all derivatives of the discovery, such as other scientists' discoveries that are based on it, technological developments based on the discoveries, products from the new technologies, and so on. A scientist can stop anyone's use of the knowledge and the reality that would not exist without it.

#### A scientist's power to its creations

Einstein, Oppenheimer, and other scientists who worked in the Manhattan Project were the creators of the knowledge that is necessary for the nuclear bombs used in World War II and the ones afterward. They regretted their contributions. However, they did not have the power to stop the using or making of nuclear weapons, which have been threatening the survival of humankind.

A scientist should have control over its creations. It is the reason why the veto power will be in the law of the Humanunity.

I will own the veto power to my knowledge about aging and all derivatives of it. In other words, I will have the power to stop anyone from using my knowledge or any of its derivatives.

Most people will be entitled to my knowledge and its derivatives, and subsequently, live healthier and longer. However, some people have to meet the [conditions of entitlement](EntitlementConditions.md).
